# Movie Watchlist

A responsive React application for tracking movies you've watched and ones you plan to watch, featuring a clean dark-themed UI.

## What is this Project?

This is a React training project I built to practice:
- Building reusable form components in React
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- Context API for global state management
- Managing and filtering data with React hooks

## Features

- Add new movies with details (title, genre, rating, notes)
- Mark movies as "Watched" or "To Watch"
- Filter your movie list by watch status
- Clean, dark-themed UI for comfortable viewing
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used

- React (with Hooks and Context API)
- Tailwind CSS v3 for styling
- JavaScript ES6+
- React Router for navigation

## Project Structure

- Context management for movie data
- Component-based architecture
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Tailwind for consistent theming and responsive design

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## What I Learned

Through building this project, I deepened my understanding of:

- **Tailwind CSS v3**: Implementing custom themes, responsive design, and utility-first CSS
- **Form Control**: Building controlled components and handling form state in React
- **Advanced useState**: Managing complex state objects and form data
- **useContext**: Creating global state accessible throughout the application

## Areas for Improvement

This is a learning project and could be improved in many ways:
- Adding persistent storage (localStorage or database)
- Movie search and sort functionality
- Adding movie poster images
- Authentication for multiple users
- Better performance optimization for larger lists

Feel free to fork this project and make it better! Any suggestions or contributions are welcome.
